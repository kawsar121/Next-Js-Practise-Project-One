* crate a not found page for showing any not founding page, page name must be (not-found.js)

          ##  **image Optimization**
        ___________________________
* For Extrnal Image : make sure next.config.js file this type 
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  /* config options here */
  reactCompiler: true,
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: '**',
      },
    ],
  },
};
module.exports = nextConfig;

* Image have must be width and height
* For Local Image : make a assests folder in scr folder. and import this image  
preveous type like react. not must be requerd width and height like extarnal image.

               ## **Use Meta Data For Page Title**
* make one by one page title follow this code 
export const metadata = {
  title: "Next App",
  description: "Generated by KB",
};
